README:  
these folders are datafiles collected from different labs  
plots are created via MNE `plot_psd_topo`  
- left column of plots: "pure" channels names (i.e., "C4", "F3", ...)
- right column of plots: "referenced" channels names (i.e., "C4:A1", "F3:A2", ...)
- (note: "pure" channel names could also be e.g. mastoid-referenced, but not labelled as such)
